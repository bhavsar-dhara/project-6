You Decide - Project Readme file

This project will help you create a folder in the app for the location you or you want to visit and then add the memories from your gallery to the app for easier access.

Initially you will land on the "Add Places" screen which has a plus sign on the top right corner which will allow the user to add the location using the Google Places AutoComplete API. This will add a cell onto the collection view on the (home screen/add places) screen.

On selecting any of the location/cells will take you to the details page of the location which has two more buttons to allow the user to view the location on Apple Maps and gallery to allow the user to add or view the memories. 
The user will be able to add the memories from their gallery.

All of these data is stored using Core Data which will allow the user to view all these info anytime and anywhere.

App Supported Versions:
- iOS 15.2+
- Swift 5.5+
- Xcode 12.3+
